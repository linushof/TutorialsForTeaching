# TutorialsForTeaching

This repository collects tutorials that we use when teaching some of the [courses](https://www.msl.mgt.tum.de/en/brm/teaching/course-portfolio/) currently offered by the Professorship for Behavioral Research Methods at TUM School of Management.
The underlying motivation is that statistics and methods courses often rely on programming languages, software, or technical concepts that not every attendee is familiar with at the start of the course.
For example, many statistics courses are based on the `R` programming language, and students new to `R` might be more concerned with understanding the `R` code than the actual statistical concept.
An effective tutorial should help beginners to quickly learn the important basics and achieve the required base level of knowledge and skills to be able to follow the course contents and not be distracted too much by problems with the tools.

## Work in progress

Everyone (also outside of TUM) can make use of the tutorials. 
However, all tutorials should be considered work in progress and can be subject to future changes.
